## Test Failure Analysis

| File | Line | Cause |
|------|------|-------|
| math_test.go | 23 | TestMultiply failed: expected result 15 but got 12 |
| math_test.go | 31 | TestDivide failed: expected result 2 but got 0 |

## Root Cause Analysis

The test failures indicate issues with the mathematical operations in your code:
- **TestMultiply**: The multiplication function is returning 12 instead of 15, suggesting incorrect multiplication logic
- **TestDivide**: The division function is returning 0 instead of 2, which could indicate integer division issues or incorrect implementation

## Suggested Fixes

### 1. **Fix the Multiply Function**
The test expects 15 but gets 12. This suggests the multiply function might be adding instead of multiplying (3 + 4 + 5 = 12) or has some other logic error.

### 2. **Fix the Divide Function**
The function returns 0 instead of 2, which commonly happens with integer division in Go when dividing smaller numbers by larger ones, or when there's a logic error.

### 3. **Example Fix Implementation**
Here's a likely fix for both functions:

```go
// Assuming these are the problematic functions
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b  // Ensure multiplication, not addition
}

func Divide(a, b int) int {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0  // Handle division by zero
    }
    return a / b  // Ensure correct operand order
}
```

**Next Steps:**
- Review the actual implementation of `Multiply` and `Divide` functions
- Check the test cases to ensure they're testing with the correct input values
- Run the tests locally before pushing to verify the fixes
