## Test Failure Analysis

| File | Line | Cause |
|------|------|-------|
| math_test.go | 8 | TestAdd failed: expected result 4 but got 5 |
| math_test.go | 8 | TestSubtract failed: expected result 5 but got 4 |

## Root Cause Analysis

The test failures indicate that the `Add` and `Subtract` functions are returning incorrect results. Interestingly, the actual values are swapped compared to the expected values:
- `TestAdd` expects 4 but gets 5
- `TestSubtract` expects 5 but gets 4

This pattern suggests the function implementations might be swapped or the test assertions might be incorrectly referencing the wrong functions.

## Suggested Fixes

### 1. **Verify Function Implementations**
Check if the `Add` and `Subtract` functions are correctly implemented. The swapped values suggest they might be performing the opposite operations.

### 2. **Review Test Assertions**
Ensure the test cases are calling the correct functions. The test might be calling `Subtract` when it means to call `Add` and vice versa.

### 3. **Check Test Data**
Verify that the test inputs and expected outputs are correct. Here's an example of what the test might look like and how to fix it:

```go
// Example fix if the test assertions were swapped
func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 2)
    if result != 4 {  // Ensure this is testing Add, not Subtract
        t.Errorf("expected 4, got %d", result)
    }
}

func TestSubtract(t *testing.T) {
    result := Subtract(7, 2)
    if result != 5 {  // Ensure this is testing Subtract, not Add
        t.Errorf("expected 5, got %d", result)
    }
}
```
